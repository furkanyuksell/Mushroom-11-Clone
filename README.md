# Mushroom-11-Clone

ü•∑üèª I am making a clone of the Mushroom-11 game. This game has a unique core mechanic. The game progresses by using destruction and growth mechanics and transforming into different shapes to overcome obstacles. 
- What I want to do in this clone game is to improve the destruction and growth mechanics.My biggest goal is for the game to perform the destruction and growth functions smoothly without any lag, even in very large sizes.
